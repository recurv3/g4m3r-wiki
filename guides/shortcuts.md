# Shortcuts

## What Are Shortcuts?

Shortcuts are shorter versions of commands which can be created by server admins + mods to make it easier to type commands that are used often. Shortcuts can be made for the server or for the user.

## User Shortcuts

User shortcuts will work only for the user that created it and on any server they are on.

**Note:** User shortcuts can only be created in a Private Message with the bot.

### Step 1: Starting The Creation

First, lets open the shortcuts menu by doing **.shortcut add**.

### Step 2: Selecting A Shortcut Name

The bot will ask you what shortcut you'd like to create. For example, I want to make a shortcut for the command **.vainglory hero**, so I will type in **vgh** as the name of the shortcut.

### Step 3: Selecting The Command To Run

Then the bot will ask you what command that shortcut is going to execute, in my case I will type in **vainglory hero**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note:** Do not add the prefix before the command while setting up a shortcut. Prefixes will be added automatically by the bot.
{% endhint %}

Done! In my case, I can now execute the the shortcut by typing **.vgh** on any server.

## Server Shortcuts

These shortcuts will only work in the server they're created.

### Step 1: Adding A New Server Shortcut

First, lets open the shortcuts menu by doing **.shortcut add**.



The bot will ask you what shortcut you'd like to create. This is the name of the shortcut you want to use. I will type in **news** as that is what I want to trigger this shortcut. So whenever, someone on my server types **.news** the .



{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This is useful if you have a role that gets notified every time you make an announcement or a change in your server!
{% endhint %}
